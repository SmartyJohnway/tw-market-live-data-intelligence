# HANDOFF.md — Current Operational Handoff

## Status

Date: **2026-09-23**

Baseline main before this documentation-governance consolidation:

`f70c5d8dcd580bbd6c9c66d15dbf76d56ca84c96`

Current workstream:

> **Repository documentation/governance consolidation. Phase I is explicitly
> not started.**

The purpose of this handoff is to let a new human or agent resume without
reconstructing the repository from hundreds of historical milestone documents.

## Most recent accepted runtime milestones

## Current runtime truth

```text
Accepted Requests     V1 / V2 / V3
Preferred Request     V3
Preferred new Result  V3
Preferred new Audit   V3
MCP tools             exactly 6
Phase H active source count  1
Active Phase H route         H1-TPEX-ATTENTION-OPENAPI
H1 complete coverage         NO
H2 activation                NOT STARTED
H3 activation                NOT STARTED
Phase I                      NOT STARTED
```

V1/V2 remain compatibility contracts. Existing persisted artifacts retain their
stored schema version.

## Phase G truth

The accepted PR-D closure proves the initial G1/G2 production slice:

- material disclosures;
- monthly revenue;
- TWSE/TPEX eligible company common-share scope;
- official bounded source acquisition;
- Result/Audit/citation integration.

Primary evidence:

- `docs/acceptance_runs/phase_g_pr_d_closure.json`
- `docs/acceptance_runs/phase_g_pr_d_p0_ledger.json`
- `docs/acceptance_runs/phase_g_pr_d_controlled_live.json`

Do not convert this into a claim that every Roadmap V3.2 Phase G research item
is complete.

## Phase H truth

Primary current evidence:

- `docs/governance/phase_h/PHASE_H_H_ACT_H1_TPEX_ATTENTION_ACCEPTANCE_LEDGER.json`
- `docs/governance/phase_h/PHASE_H_H_ACC_7L_SELECTED_PRODUCT_LIVE_E2E_LEDGER.json`
- `docs/governance/phase_h/PHASE_H_H_ACT_V3_PROMOTION_ACCEPTANCE_LEDGER.json`
- `docs/data_capabilities/unified_market_evidence_capability_catalog.v3.json`
- `docs/data_capabilities/m8r_05b_capability_to_executor_routing_matrix.v3.json`

Important distinction:

> H-ACT-V3 is closed; the full Roadmap Phase H capability scope is not.

The active H1 product slice is TPEx attention only. H2 and H3 remain
non-executable unless a later independently governed activation changes that.

## Current documentation problem being closed

Before this consolidation, repository documentation had multiple competing
eras:

- root/product docs partly current;
- `docs/roadmap/M8_POST_M8C_REVISED_ROADMAP.md` still acted like a current
  roadmap while containing obsolete phase definitions and pre-v1 release prose;
- several operator/reference/architecture pages still described the M5/M6
  product model;
- historical acceptance and reviews correctly preserved old facts but were easy
  to mistake for current state;
- root `AGENTS.md` still described a high-freedom source-discovery project
  rather than the governed product now in the repository.

This consolidation establishes the four-file governance front door:

```text
PROJECT.md   current project/product state
ROADMAP.md   durable Roadmap V3.2 direction and phase scope
HANDOFF.md   current operational stopping point and evidence pointers
AGENTS.md    repository/agent working rules
```

## Resume order

A new agent should read, in order:

1. `PROJECT.md`
2. `ROADMAP.md`
3. `HANDOFF.md`
4. `AGENTS.md`
5. current Catalog/Route authority
6. only then the specific frozen contract/ledger relevant to the task

Do not start by reading hundreds of `docs/reviews/` or `docs/protocol/`
files unless the task requires historical evidence.

## Current allowed next work

Complete the documentation/governance consolidation:

- current front-door docs;
- archive/superseded roadmap organization;
- current operator/reference/architecture entry points;
- documentation audit and lifecycle labels;
- regression validation.

## Explicit stop boundary

**Do not implement Phase I.**

Roadmap Phase I is Cross-Market & Optional Context. It requires a separate
Owner decision and its own evidence-value/source/identity/timing preflight.
This documentation task is not that authorization.

## Before any future Phase I work

At minimum:

1. read `ROADMAP.md` Phase I;
2. establish a Phase I preflight rather than immediately integrating data;
3. apply the Evidence Value Gate to each candidate evidence family;
4. keep derivatives identity separate from cash-security ISIN identity;
5. preserve explicit/optional bounded loading;
6. obtain explicit Owner authorization for implementation.

## Historical-document rule

Do not "fix" accepted historical ledgers to match the current V3 state. A
statement such as "V2 remained preferred" inside an H-ACT-H1 ledger is correct
for that gate's time and must remain intact.

Current-state contradictions belong in current entry-point docs, not by
rewriting history.
