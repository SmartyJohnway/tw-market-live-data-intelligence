Safe commands: `python -m compileall scripts tests`, `pytest -m "not network"`, and `python scripts/run_local_delivery_acceptance.py --check-only`. Boundaries: no live probes, no production refresh, no frontend/public writes, no trading signals, no realtime guarantee.


## M4 Omega

Adds local-only fixture-only governed platform skeleton: governance policy, source registry, evidence ledger, fixture replay, readonly observability, release gates, authorization ladder, and operator checks.

## M5FGH product convergence status

PR #59 / M5E is treated as merged upstream. M5FGH converges the reviewed M5C/M5D historical evidence into the current canonical local product line: `research/staging/m5f/m5f_canonical_market_context_01/canonical_market_context.json` is the only source-of-truth payload for browser preview, FastAPI readonly endpoints, MCP readonly tools, and AI briefing artifacts.

North Star: a local-first, bounded-watchlist, explicit manual-refresh Taiwan market context center shared by browser and AI Agents. The package is historical/stale reviewed evidence for 0050, 00929, and 2330 from TWSE_OpenAPI source date 2026-06-26; it is not realtime, not production current state, not full-market coverage, and not a trading signal.

Historical M3 generated artifacts under `research/generated/` remain legacy generated artifacts. M5F is the current canonical consumer package. Bounded live evidence exists in prior governed evidence, so the repo is not fixture-only, but M5FGH does not run new live probes. The only remaining main bundle after this closure is M5IJ for future explicitly authorized refresh execution and final release hardening.


## M5IJ local product release

M5F is the canonical product context. M5I is explicit bounded refresh only; M5J is final local release hardening. Default startup makes no market-data network calls. Refresh requires explicit single-use authorization and is bounded to the configured watchlist and product scope. Failed refresh preserves last-known-good M5F. No full-market scan, polling, frontend/public publication, research/generated refresh, production/prod write, broker/auth, automatic order, trading signal, target price, ranking, or recommendation is allowed. FastAPI `/api/probe/*` is disabled pending M5I and returns 410.

Required commands:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -m "not network" -v
python scripts/validate_m5f_canonical_market_context_package.py --package-dir research/staging/m5f/m5f_canonical_market_context_01
python scripts/run_m5ij_end_to_end_acceptance.py --check-only
uvicorn server.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
python server/mcp_server.py --startup-check
```

Explicit authorization refresh command, if supported by the operator environment:

```bash
python scripts/run_m5i_explicit_bounded_refresh.py --execute-refresh --authorization-token <authorization.json> --source TWSE_OpenAPI --targets 0050 00929 2330 --no-frontend-publication --no-production-refresh --no-generated-refresh --no-trading-output
```
